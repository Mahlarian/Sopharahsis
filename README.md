# Sopharahsis
This project is built using Discord Bot Maker as it's foundation, along with modifications and code of my own.

You are more than welcome to use the code here as a learning foundation, however, you may **not** use any raw data from this bot. The data remains unencrypted so users can view how a command works, and will always remain unencrypted. Server and Player (user) data is not uploaded to this repository for safety and security reasons, along with any API's tokens.

**If you are looking for help on this bot, please use the `s!help` command within a Discord server that has Sopharahsis. For more information, you can also visit the Wiki at the top of this page.**

**Encounter an issue? Please send a report in the "Issues" tab at the top of this page. Issue status will be marked with a tag to confirm if they've been patched, re-created, or do not exist.**
