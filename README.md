# Sopharahsis [ARCHIVE]
**__THIS HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED ON 02/09/2020. NEWER VERSIONS CAN BE SEEN IN THE NEW MASTER/BETA BRANCHES, AND THIS WILL REMAIN AS AN ARCHIVE. THE NEW VERSION OF SOPHARAHSIS WILL USE ONLY JAVASCRIPT, AND NO LONGER USES DISCORD BOT MAKER__**

===========ARCHIVE STARTS HERE===========

This project is built using Discord Bot Maker as it's foundation, along with modifications and code of my own.

You are more than welcome to use the code here as a learning foundation, however, you may **not** use any raw data from this bot. The data remains unencrypted so users can view how a command works, and will always remain unencrypted. Server and Player (user) data is not uploaded to this repository for safety and security reasons, along with any API's tokens.

**If you are looking for help on this bot, please use the `s!help` command within a Discord server that has Sopharahsis. For more information, you can also visit the Wiki at the top of this page.**

**Encounter an issue? Please send a report in the "Issues" tab at the top of this page. Issue status will be marked with a tag to confirm if they've been patched, re-created, or do not exist.**

**If you are viewing the code, it is recommended you use a [JSON beautifier](http://jsonpathfinder.com/). Copy the raw code, and paste it in the box on the left, then click "beautify".**
